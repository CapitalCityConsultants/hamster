Hamster can be found packaged in most distributions. The instructions below
are for installing from sources for testing and development purposes.

The instructions are mix between Gnome 2 and Gnome 3, so, errm, just bear with
us.

h1. hamster-applet -> hamster-time-tracker clean up

Previously hamster was installed everywhere under @hamster-applet@. As
the applet is long gone, the paths and file names have changed to
@hamster-time-tracker@. To clean up previous install follow these steps:

pre. git checkout d140d45f105d4ca07d4e33bcec1fae30143959fe
./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf uninstall

h1. Dependencies

Debian-based: @apt-get install git-core gettext intltool python-gconf@
RPM-based: @yum install git-core gettext intltool gnome-python2-gconf@

h1. Installing

pre. ./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf install

After that make sure that the old daemons aren't roaming around:

pre. killall hamster-service && killall hamster-windows-service

Make sure gconf settings are owned by you and not root:

pre. cd ~/.gconf/apps/
ls -l | grep hamster-time-tracker
sudo chown -R <user>:<group> hamster-time-tracker

Now restart your panels/dockies and you should be able to add hamster to your panel!

h2. Required

pre. sudo apt-get install python-requests python-beaker
